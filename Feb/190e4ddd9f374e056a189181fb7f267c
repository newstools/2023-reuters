Feb 18 (Reuters) - Pepsico Inc (PEP.O) recalled more than 25,000 cases of Starbucks (SBUX.O) chilled coffee drink after glass was found in some of the bottles, the U.S. Food and Drug administration said in a notice.

The FDA classified this as a Class 2 recall, which means the "product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote", according the agency's website. Distributed nationwide by PepsiCo, the bottles with expiration dates Mar. 8th, May 29th, Jun. 4th and 10th, have been affected, according to the notice.
