Feb 1 (Reuters) - Airlines canceled over 1,800 flights in the United States on Wednesday, after an ice storm hit states from Texas to West Virginia. A total of 1,897 flights within, into or out of the United States were canceled, while 750 flights were delayed as of 8.41 a.m. ET, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware. "This week's winter storm is having an impact on our operations, accounting for a significant number of cancelations," American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) said in a statement, adding that it proactively canceled flights and notified passengers. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday warned in a tweet that travelers could expect to see some snowy conditions in certain areas including Dallas, Fort Worth and Memphis, which could delay certain flights.
