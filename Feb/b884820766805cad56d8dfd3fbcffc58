(Reuters) - Law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft has hired prominent Washington, D.C., lawyer Martin Weinstein to run its government investigations and corporate compliance practice. Weinstein arrives at Cadwalader along with his longtime practice partner Jeffrey D. Clark from law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Both Weinstein and Clark will work in the firm’s global litigation group in D.C., the firm said. Weinstein said Cadwalader’s reputation in litigation and the firm’s presence both in the United States and in London made it an appealing destination for his practice, which focuses heavily on cross-border investigations. Weinstein has represented companies in foreign bribery investigations, an area of increasing scrutiny for the U.S. Justice Department that has led to major corporate settlements in recent years. His clients have included Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, French telecom company Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise and Tyco International Ltd. Weinstein said there’s been “an extremely vigorous” white-collar enforcement environment driven by greater Justice Department scrutiny on corporate misconduct and record payouts from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s whistleblower program. The program allows tipsters to collect a portion of an SEC fine if their information leads to an enforcement action against a company. Weinstein said the mandatory retirement policy at Willkie was one “factor” in his decision to join Cadwalader. He declined to discuss the details of the policy but said he was “excited to be a full-on practitioner for the foreseeable future.” A Willkie spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
