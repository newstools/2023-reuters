ISTANBUL, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Tuesday that the death toll from the earthquakes centred in southeastern Turkey rose to 3,419, bringing the total including those killed in Syria to more than 5,000. Speaking to reporters, Oktay said severe weather conditions made it difficult to bring aid to the affected regions and conduct rescues. He said only rescue and aid vehicles were being allowed to enter or leave Hatay, Kahramanmaras and Adiyaman, three of the most impacted provinces. Rescue operations are focusing on those three provinces and Malatya, Oktay added. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
