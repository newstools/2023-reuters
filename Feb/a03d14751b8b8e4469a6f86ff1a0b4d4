(Reuters) - Boston-based law firm Foley Hoag said Monday that it has opened a new office in Denver, marking its first U.S. outpost outside the Northeast. Partners Christopher Mosley and Brooke Yates, who joined remotely from Denver-founded midsize firm Sherman & Howard in April, will lead the new office. Associate Stephen Robin will join the team Monday. Mosley and Yates advise companies on insurance recovery, and Yates also counsels clients on multi-party commercial litigation nationally and internationally, the firm said. Foley Hoag now has five offices, including in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., and Paris, France. "Denver is a dynamic city with business strengths that align well with our platform, including in clean energy, healthcare, life sciences, cannabis, and technology," Foley Hoag managing partner Jim Bucking said in a statement. Yates said the team brought their clients along with them and have expanded their base since moving, though she declined to name specific clients. A representative from Sherman & Howard, which has about 170 lawyers and eight offices across the Southwestern United States, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Several firms have opened and grown in the Mountain West in the last two or three years. In addition to Colorado, Salt Lake City, Utah, has attracted a number of firms since 2021, including Silicon Valley-founded Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Chicago-founded Kirkland & Ellis and Foley & Lardner.
