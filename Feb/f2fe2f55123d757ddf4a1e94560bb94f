Feb 9 (Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said on Thursday that European countries were trying to hide the results of their investigations into last year's blasts on the Nord Stream gas pipelines, accusing them of covering up who was to blame. "The investigation is being carried out in such a way that... the remains are literally and figuratively left in the water," Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said, according to the state-run RIA news agency. The blasts, which are being investigated by Swedish and Danish authorities, could put three of Nord Stream 1 and 2's four undersea lines permanently out of use. Moscow had asked Stockholm to be allowed to join the investigation, but both Sweden and Denmark rejected the idea of Russian participation. Construction of Nord Stream 2, designed to carry Russian gas to Germany, was completed in September 2021. Berlin shelved its certification just days before Moscow invaded Ukraine in February. Swedish and other European investigators say the attacks were carried out on purpose, but they have not said who they think was responsible. Moscow, without providing evidence, has blamed the explosions on Western sabotage. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
