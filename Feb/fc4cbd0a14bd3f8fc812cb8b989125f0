NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Cryptocurrency could use a reputational boost right now. So it’s problematic that those who could help legitimize the business aren’t going gangbusters. Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm that helps snuff out shenanigans in crypto, is laying off almost 5% of its roughly 900-person staff as part of a pivot to focus more on public-sector clients. Government entities including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission account for 60% of the firm’s revenue, and U.S. agencies currently have at least 10 active contracts with Chainalysis. But a string of bankruptcies in the business has clients cutting back on spending – and some disappearing completely. While Chainalysis, backed by GIC, says it plans to grow overall headcount in 2023, the cuts are the wrong sign for those who use its services. Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKa.N) Charlie Munger this week called on the U.S. government to ban crypto entirely, saying in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that it was “wild and wooly capitalism.” Having more companies – and government agencies – who pay outfits to keep tabs on the blockchain could bring much-needed reassurances.
