Feb 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon expects U.S. interest rates could hit 6%, he said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. The Federal Reserve quickly caught up to out-of-control inflation and would probably pause interest rates at a little over 5%, but they may need to go higher, Dimon told CNBC. “I suspect (interest rates) may have to go a little bit higher than 5 we're talking about. It could hit 6,” he added. The Fed's policy rate is now in a range between 4.50% and 4.75%.
