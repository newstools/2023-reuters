HONG KONG, Feb 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The carmaker says a new $3.5 billion battery plant will create some 2,500 jobs and bring more manufacturing back to Michigan, the traditional heart of the U.S. automobile industry. It’s evident that President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act “did what it was intended to do”, according to one executive. Not exactly: the factory runs on Chinese know-how. Ford Motor (F.N) is licensing technology and services from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology (300750.SZ), rather than buying batteries directly or forming a joint venture. This unusual setup allows the American auto veteran to use CATL’s lithium ferro-phosphate (LFP) chemistry whilst satisfying the IRA’s demands. It also, however, highlights an awkward fact: many Chinese companies, including the world’s largest battery maker, are miles ahead of their U.S. peers. LFP, which is cheaper and safer than competing chemistries, accounted for nearly 40% of the global market by the end of 2022, Bernstein estimates. But although it was invented in North America, Chinese suppliers dominate the supply chain: LFP makes up more than half of production at CATL, BYD (002594.SZ), (1211.HK), CALB (3931.HK), EVE Energy (300014.SZ) and Gotion High Tech (002074.SZ), according to UBS. As automakers start mass-producing electric vehicles, they will depend on Chinese suppliers, wherever they locate their factories.
