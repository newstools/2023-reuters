Feb 28 (Reuters) - A Trump administration policy that allowed companies to ship some U.S. technology below the “5G level” to China’s blacklisted telecommunications equipment maker Huawei is “under assessment,” a key U.S. official said on Tuesday. “A licensing rule of the previous administration still stands for Huawei that allows things below 5G, below cloud level, to go, and I will say that all those things are under assessment,” U.S. Commerce Department official Alan Estevez, who oversees export control policy, said at a Congressional hearing.
