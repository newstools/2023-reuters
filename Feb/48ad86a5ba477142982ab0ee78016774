He had said at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in August that the third part of his Master Plan was "going to fundamentally be about scaling" - with regards to both car production and the supply chain that supports it. At the upcoming investor day to be held at its gigafactory in Texas, Tesla is set to discuss expansion plans, capital allocation and its third-generation platform for cars, which is expected to lower production costs. In the second part of his Master Plan, Musk said he wanted to expand the EV product line to address all major segments and develop self-driving capability that is 10 times safer than human driving. The plan also said Tesla would create solar roofs tied to battery storage and enable cars to earn owners money when not in use. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
