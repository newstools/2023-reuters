LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - BP (BP.L) is trying to stop the rot. The $108 billion UK oil group’s bumper 2022 results on Tuesday recorded a stellar 30.5% return on average capital employed. Yet Chief Executive Bernard Looney presides over a company that trades on less than 3 times forecast 2023 EBITDA and has underperformed its big oil major rivals since he was unveiled as boss in February 2020. His solution is to do what higher-valued U.S. oil groups like Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) do: pump more oil. In fairness, Looney is still planning to sign off on 50 gigawatts of wind and solar investments by 2030. And he wants energy-transition assets like hydrogen, bioenergy and electric-vehicle charging to account for up to half BP’s annual $14 billion to $18 billion of capital investment. But fresh investment in oil and gas means he only plans to cut oil production by 25% by 2030, rather than 40%. BP shares rose 5% on the news. But apply Exxon’s 2025 multiple to the $49 billion of EBITDA Looney now thinks he could make in the same year, and his market capitalisation should exceed $300 billion, or three times its current level. The reason that probably won’t happen any time soon is that BP is still planning to cut oil production and hike non-fossil fuel investment more than American rivals. One of them may lob in a bid. Otherwise, BP may remain too dirty for sustainable investors, and too clean for the rest. (By George Hay) Follow @Breakingviews on Twitter (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.
