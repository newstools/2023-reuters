Feb 25 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit fell, reflecting lower gains from investments and foreign currency exchange losses as the U.S. dollar lost value. Berkshire also repurchased $2.6 billion of its own stock in the quarter, boosting full-year buybacks to $7.9 billion. Quarterly net income fell 54% to $18.16 billion, or $12,412 per Class A share, from $39.65 billion, or $26,690 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit fell 8% to $6.71 billion, or $4,596 per Class A share, from $7.29 billion. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
