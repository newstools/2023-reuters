MUMBAI, Feb 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - New Delhi has finally come good on its promise to convert Vodafone Idea’s (VODA.NS) dues worth $2 billion into an equity stake. Feeding an apple to the country’s smallest telecom operator in a three-horse race prevents a duopoly and lets the government focus its energies on the more pressing crisis at the Adani group. The state’s move, which dialed up a 10% gain in Vodafone Idea’s stock, could ease the company’s pressures elsewhere. The banks it has been courting may now be more willing to help raise the more than $850 million needed to meet upcoming vendor payments, for example. A recently extended repayment schedule for $194 million of cash owed to American Tower (AMT.N) should bolster its chances, too. The company, though, still has another $25 billion of debt. And it is also hemorrhaging subscribers. That can only be stemmed with a faster transition to 5G technology, which requires more investment. Official largesse comes with strings attached. India’s Telecommunications Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Friday that concomitant with the swap is a “firm commitment” of fresh capital from the Aditya Birla group, Vodafone Idea’s second-largest shareholder. For a group that has often expressed a wish to exit the telecom business, the bailout must feel like a Pyrrhic victory.
