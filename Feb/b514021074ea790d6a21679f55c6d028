Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S.-founded global law firm White & Case said on Thursday that it has hired tax partner Jessica Kemp in London from Travers Smith. Kemp advises clients on tax matters pertaining to mergers and acquisitions, restructurings and capital markets, White & Case said. Oliver Brettle, a member of White & Case's global executive committee, said Kemp’s arrival is a continuation of the firm’s expansion of transactional practices in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Kemp was a partner and head of M&A tax at London-headquartered Travers Smith, White & Case said. She worked at Travers Smith for 15 years, nearly eight of those as partner, after joining from London-based global firm Clifford Chance, according to her LinkedIn profile. The UK firm has been losing partners in London to U.S. rivals recently. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett said last week that it has hired Stephanie Biggs from Travers Smith to co-lead its European financial services and funds. Private equity head Ian Shawyer left for Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton in January. Goodwin Procter hired employment partner Alex Fisher in November, and Fried Frank added private equity partner James Renahan in September. Travers Smith did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Kemp’s departure. White & Case's London office has also seen movement this year. M&A partner Ian Ivory arrived from Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, while finance partner Jill Concannon Christie left for Clifford Chance and banking partner Gilles Teerlinck joined Weil, Gotshal & Manges.
