BEIJING, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce company JD.Com (9618.HK) plans to integrate ChatGPT methods and technical points into its product services, it said on Wednesday. Rival Alibaba Group (9988.HK) is also developing a ChatGPT-style artificial intelligence (AI) tool that it said was undergoing internal testing. (This story has been corrected to show that JD.com plans to integrate some aspects of ChatGPT's technology, not ChatGPT itself.) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
