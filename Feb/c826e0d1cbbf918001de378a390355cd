MANCHESTER, England, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Police in the north of England said on Sunday they had found a body near where a woman went missing last month. Nicola Bulley, 45, was last seen walking her dog near a river in Lancashire, northwest England, on Jan. 27. Twenty-five minutes later her mobile phone, still connected to a work Teams call, was found on a bench. Her springer spaniel was found waiting nearby. Lancashire Police said they were called at 1136 GMT on Sunday to reports of a body in the River Wyre. "An underwater search team and specialist officers have subsequently attended the scene, entered the water and have sadly recovered a body," the police said in a statement on Twitter. "No formal identification has yet been carried out, so we are unable to say whether this is Nicola Bulley at this time." Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
