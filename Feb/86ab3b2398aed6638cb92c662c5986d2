Feb 24 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) said it was cooperating with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into record keeping of electronic communications of its investment advisers, according to a filing on Friday. The asset manager is the latest in a list of financial firms under the regulator's scrutiny. Earlier this week, Wells Fargo (WFC.N) said U.S. regulators were investigating the bank's retention of employee communications over "unapproved" messaging tools. The SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined 16 financial firms last year, a combined $1.8 billion after it was found that their employees had discussed deals on personal devices and apps.
