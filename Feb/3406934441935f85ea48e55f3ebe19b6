(Reuters) - Texas sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday, saying its decision to reject the state's proposed plan to control emissions that drift into neighboring states was an illegal attempt to "force" federal rules onto the state. Ken Paxton, the state's Republican attorney general, whose office filed the lawsuit in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, said in a statement the EPA had “no good reason” to reject the plan, which the state is required to submit for federal approval under the Clean Air Act. The lawsuit sets the stage for a showdown between the Biden administration and Texas over implementation of that keystone environmental law, which is used to set acceptable air quality standards for ground-level ozone and other pollution emitted by power plants and other industries that crosses state lines. “The state-level plan put forth by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality meets federal air quality standards, and the EPA’s hyper-politicized decision to reject our plan must be reversed,” Paxton said in the statement. The lawsuit was filed one day after the EPA rejected Texas’ plan, alongside disapprovals for 18 other state plans. In addition to Texas, plans submitted by California, Illinois, Alabama, Oklahoma and others were rejected. The EPA said Texas included “no permanent and enforceable emissions controls” in its submission, thus warranting rejection. The EPA also said the plan was technically deficient, and wouldn't adequately reduce emissions in neighboring states like New Mexico. The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit Tuesday. The case is State of Texas v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 23-60069.
