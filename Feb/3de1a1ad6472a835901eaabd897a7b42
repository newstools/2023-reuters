Feb 9 (Reuters) - Yahoo said on Thursday it plans to lay off more than 20% of its total workforce as part of a major restructuring of its ad tech division. The cuts will impact nearly 50% of Yahoo's ad tech employees by the end of this year, including nearly 1,000 employees this week, the company said. Yahoo, which is owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management (APO.N) since a $5 billion buyout in 2021, added that the move would enable the company to narrow its focus and investment on its flagship ad business called DSP, or demand-side platform. This comes as many advertisers have pared back their marketing budgets in response to record-high inflation rates and continued uncertainty about a recession. A raft of U.S. companies from Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) to Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) have also laid off thousands this year to ride out a demand downturn wrought by high inflation and rising interest rates. Axios first reported the news of the layoffs at Yahoo. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
