Feb 3 (Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Friday found Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO Elon Musk not liable in a securities fraud case over a tweet that he had lined up funding to take the electric car company private. Plaintiffs have claimed billions in damages and the decision also had been seen as important for Musk himself, who has aggressively fought any charges that he was guilty and defended his ability to tweet broadly.
