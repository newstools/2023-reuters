HONG KONG, Feb 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Global appetite for Chinese stocks is returning. Sensor-maker Hesai shares popped nearly 11% in what is the biggest initial public offering from the People’s Republic in New York since 2021. That bodes well for compatriots looking to list near and far. Hesai's $190 million offering is relatively small. Still, the auto-supplier sold more shares than planned and priced at the top of the range. Geopolitical tensions loom large, but money managers are warming up to all things China. The country's sudden reopening has boosted economic activity, and regulators are prioritising growth over cracking down on private firms. A December breakthrough in an auditing spat between watchdogs in Washington and Beijing has eased fears that Chinese entities could be kicked off U.S. exchanges. Hedge funds have increased their exposure to Chinese equities back to 2020 levels, Goldman Sachs data shows. Issuers are looking at multiple destinations. Hesai’s deal puts the U.S. back on the map. Switzerland is hot too: at least 30 mainland-listed companies have announced plans to issue global depositary receipts in Zurich, according to IFR, including car-battery giant CATL (300750.SZ). A steady stream of firms are mulling Hong Kong listings too. Chinese bosses have plenty of options. (By Robyn Mak) Follow @Breakingviews on Twitter (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.
