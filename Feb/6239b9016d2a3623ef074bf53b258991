NEW YORK, Feb 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Battery-powered-car makers are pulling off at the cash station. Faraday Future Intelligent Electric (FFIE.O) and Canoo (GOEV.O), two of the many companies fighting to survive an increasingly cutthroat industry, unveiled new financing plans on Monday. A recent stock rally provides an extra charge before the inevitable pileup. Faraday is selling $135 million of convertible secured notes. The $678 million luxury marque, which is backed by embattled Chinese real estate developer Evergrande and went public in a 2021 through a special purpose acquisition company, has been dogged by corporate governance disputes involving death threats and manufacturing delays. Despite having no revenue, Faraday’s market value has quadrupled since the start of the year after a roughly 90% fall. Likewise, $388 million Canoo, whose top line is nonexistent, is selling 50 million shares and 50 million warrants to raise just $52 million. The funding comes off as largely speculative. Consumers are up for grabs in the nascent electric-vehicle market, meaning stocks will whipsaw as investors do their guesswork and short-sellers cover pessimistic trades. Potential mergers, including to acquire technology, also will fuel the frenzy. Most financing deals will provide a limited charge.
