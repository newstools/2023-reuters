NEW YORK, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Star stock picker Cathie Wood's Ark Invest sold 403,990 shares of embattled crypto-focused bank Silvergate Capital Corp (SI.N) on Thursday as shares in the firm plunged more than 40%, according to disclosures by Ark Invest. The selling nearly liquidated the firm's share holdings and came from the $645 million ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF.P), and not the firm's flagship $5.9 billion ARK Innovation fund (ARKK.P), which does not have a position in the company. Silvergate Capital said it would cut its workforce by 40% after investors pulled more than $8 billion in deposits in the wake of the collapse of FTX. Total deposits from digital asset customers at Silvergate fell to $3.8 billion at the end of December, compared to $11.9 billion at the end of September. Ark Invest first bought shares in Silvergate in November, 2019, according to Morningstar data. Shares of Silvergate were down 9.2% in midday trading on Thursday, while shares of the ARK Fintech Innovation fund were up 0.8%. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
