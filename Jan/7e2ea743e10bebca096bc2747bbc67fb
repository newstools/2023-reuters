BENGALURU, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Zomato Ltd (ZOMT.NS) said on Monday Gunjan Patidar, the company's co-founder and chief technical officer, had resigned after more than a decade with the Indian food delivery firm. "Patidar was one of the first few employees of Zomato and built the core tech systems for the company," it said in a stock exchange filing. His resignation comes after a string of high-profile departures from the company in the last few months, including that of Mohit Gupta, another co-founder, deputy chief financial officer Nitin Savara and vice president of global growth Siddharth Jhawar. Zomato, which did not say why Patidar was resigning, has posted losses narrowing in its last two quarterly results. Its food delivery business' gross order values - the total value of all food delivery orders placed online on Zomato's platform - jumped 23% from a year earlier in the September quarter.
