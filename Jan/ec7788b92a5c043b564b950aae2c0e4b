SAO PAULO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Brazilian bank Banco BTG Pactual SA has appealed a court injunction that protected billionaire-backed retailer Americanas (AMER3.SA) from creditors on Friday, documents seen by Reuters show. In an appeal filed on Saturday, BTG lawyers argue the court injunction orders illegally the reversal of a payment made by Americanas to BTG. Americanas said it expects the court injunction to be maintained so the company can proceed with negotiations with creditors. BTG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
