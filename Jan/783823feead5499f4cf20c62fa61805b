Jan 11 (Reuters) - European shares edged up on Wednesday, lifted by Bayer and LVMH, while optimism over reopening in China and hopes of less aggressive U.S. interest rate hikes aided the sentiment. The pan-regional STOXX 600 (.STOXX) gained 0.1% by 0818 GMT. Wall Street ended higher on Tuesday and European stocks cut some losses, on risk appetite spurred by expectations of softer U.S. inflation print this week and relief after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell refrained from commenting on U.S. rate policy.

Energy stocks (.SXEP) advanced 1.0%, while miners (.SXPP) gained 1.7%, as commodity prices rose on optimism over top consumer China's reopening.

Bayer (BAYGn.DE) rose 2.1% after Bloomberg reported that activist investor Bluebell is pushing for a breakup of the German pharmaceutical company. Deliveroo (ROO.L) fell 4.4% on a ratings cut by J.P.Morgan.
