Jan 22 (Reuters) - Members of two local unions at CNH Industrial NV (CNHI.MI) factories in Wisconsin and Iowa reached an agreement over a new labor contract on Saturday, ending a strike that has been ongoing since last May, the United Auto Workers union said. The contract, which was voted on as an improved "last, best, and final offer" by CNH Industrial workers, included wage increases, shift premium increases, classification upgrades and as other improvements, the UAW said in a statement. The UAW, which represents more than 1,000 hourly workers at the two plants, did not disclose details of the vote. CNH officials could not immediately be reached for comment. More than 1,000 union members in Racine, Wisconsin, and Burlington, Iowa, walked off their equipment-making jobs in May after a six-year contract expired at the facilities. The agreement came after the local unions had this month rejected a tentative contract. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
