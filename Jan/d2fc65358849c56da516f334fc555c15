WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Wednesday that the some users of a pilot messaging database that failed earlier this month are reporting slower response times, but the issue is not impacting flights. The FAA said the Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system "is online and operational. Some users have reported slower response times due to high demand, but there have been no reports of impact to flight operations." The NOTAM system failure prompted a nationwide groundstop on Jan. 11 that disrupted more than 11,000 flights. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
