Jan 24 (Reuters) - Foxconn (2317.TW) and other Taiwanese tech suppliers are increasing their production capacity in Mexico to meet a growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and servers to be made in North America, Nikkei Asia reported on Tuesday. Mexico is one of the key locations for the Foxconn's strategic investments this year, according to the report, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
