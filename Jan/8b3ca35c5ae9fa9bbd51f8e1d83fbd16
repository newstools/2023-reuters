Jan 5 (Reuters) - Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) reported a net quarterly loss on Thursday as it took a $6.5 billion opioid litigation charge, sending its shares down nearly 2% in premarket trade. Walgreens and rivals CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N) in November last year agreed to pay about $13.8 billion to resolve thousands of U.S. state and local lawsuits accusing the pharmacy chains of mishandling opioid pain drugs. CVS took a pre-tax charge of $5.2 billion in its third quarter related to the settlement. Walgreens, one of the largest U.S. pharmacies, had been relying on gains from administering COVID-19 vaccines to tide over losses from low prescription volumes due to the pandemic, but has seen demand for the shots fall from the peak last year. It administered about 8 million vaccines in the first quarter down from 15.6 million in the same period a year earlier. Pharmacy sales during the quarter dropped about 4% even as demand for cough and cold drugs has been high amid one of the worst U.S. flu seasons in a decade. The drugstore chain has been looking to expand beyond its core business and spent $5.5 billion in 2021 to take majority stakes in health care providers VillageMD and CareCentrix. In November, Walgreens said it was acquiring urgent care provider Summit Health through its VillageMD unit in a deal valued at $9 bln to expand its healthcare footprint. Net loss attributable to Walgreens was $3.72 billion, or $4.31 per share, for the quarter ended Nov. 30, compared with a profit of $3.58 billion, or $4.13 per share, a year earlier including a one-time gain of $2.5 billion. Excluding items, the company earned $1.16 per share in the first quarter, above Refinitiv IBES estimates of $1.14 a share. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
