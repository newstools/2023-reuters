PARIS, Jan 11 (Reuters) - A man with a knife attacked six people at the Gare du Nord train station in Paris on Wednesday morning, leaving one with major injuries, a police spokesperson said. The attacker was shot several times by police and taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries, the spokesperson added. The man's motives were not immediately clear, police said. The Paris prosecutor said in a statement that a criminal investigation had been opened. One police source said the officer who shot the attacker was off-duty. The station is one of the busiest in Europe and a major link between Paris, London and the north of Europe. Police secured the area following the attack, which happened around 0645 CET (0545 GMT).
