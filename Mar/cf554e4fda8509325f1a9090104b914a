NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday rejected a proposal to list and trade shares of the VanEck Bitcoin Trust, marking the third time the regulator has denied VanEck proposals for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The SEC has rejected a raft of ETFs that proposed tracking the digital asset, including VanEck's previous applications in June last year and in November 2021, over concerns of manipulation in the underlying market.
