PARIS, March 9 (Reuters) - German air taxi developer Lilium Air Mobility (5KD.F), said on Thursday it had reached a maximum speed of 250 kilometres per hour with a technology demonstrator, calling it a key milestone on the way to certifying its electrically powered flying shuttles in 2025. The threshold was reached during testing of the Phoenix 2 vehicle at a flight test centre in southern Spain, the company told Reuters after posting a teaser video on social media. Lilium is competing in a crowded market for electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles, hoping to replace road trips or short hops by aircraft or helicopters. It plans a cruise speed of 250 km or 155 miles per hour. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
