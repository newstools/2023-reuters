NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Want to bet on a match where the outcome is fixed in advance? World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE.N) thinks so. The league is in talks with U.S. state gambling regulators to legalize bets on its staged matches, according to CNBC. It’s an invitation to insider-trading-like scandal, without extreme vigilance. Gambling has proliferated with the rise of online casinos and digital firms like $9 billion DraftKings (DKNG.O). Punters can bet on political races, weather or national debt default. In most cases, these are events where the result is unknown, which assures a somewhat level playing field between participants. The Oscars, which can also be bet on through sites like DraftKings, show how WWE’s plan for betting in pre-ordained results might work. For WWE the number of insiders may be bigger: Writers, trainers and wrestlers might be among those with an idea of what’s in store. Regulators would need to get comfortable. Still, the spread of more innovative ways to gamble is probably inevitable. Overseas bettors can already wager on an upcoming six-woman tag WWE team match, the Eurovision Song Contest and Love Island 2023. Meanwhile, the WWE has put itself up for sale, so some theatrical limbering up for future revenue opportunities is a smart way to juice the price.
