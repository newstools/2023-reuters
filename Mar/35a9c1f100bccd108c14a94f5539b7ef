March 9 (Reuters) - Three Los Angeles police officers were shot and wounded on Wednesday evening but were in stable condition while the suspect "was pronounced deceased", the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said. During a search for the suspect, a parolee at large, officers discovered that he was unresponsive, LAPD said in a post on Twitter. "LA Fire personnel responded and provided treatment, however the suspect was pronounced deceased at scene," the department said. It did not say how the suspect died.
