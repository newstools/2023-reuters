NAIROBI, March 4 (Reuters) - Kenya was hit by a nationwide power blackout on Saturday evening caused by a "system disturbance", electricity distributor Kenya Power (KPLC.NR) said. "We are working to restore normalcy within the shortest time possible," Kenya Power said in a statement. Kenya Power is the country's sole electricity distributor and the bulk of its power comes from Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) (KEGN.NR), which is the main producer.
