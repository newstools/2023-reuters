BEIJING, March 5 (Reuters) - China's nearly 3,000-member National People's Congress (NPC), the country's legislature, kicked off its annual gathering in Beijing on Sunday, with delegates set to review government reports and choose its leaders for the next five years. This year also marks the start of China's country's 14th legislature, whose delegates serve five-year terms. When the full parliament is not in session, laws can be passed by the NPC Standing Committee. Following is a schedule in local time (eight hours ahead of GMT) for the session, which ends on March 13.
