BEIJING, March 9 (Reuters) - China is opposed to a Dutch plan for restrictions on exports of semiconductor technology, China's foreign ministry said on Thursday. The Netherlands' government on Wednesday said it planned new restrictions on exports of semiconductor technology to protect national security, joining a U.S. effort to curb chip exports to the world second-biggest economy. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning, asked about the Dutch decision at a regular media briefing, said China had lodged representations with the Netherlands. "We are firmly opposed to the Netherlands' usage of administrative means to intervene and limit normal economic and trade exchanges between Chinese and Dutch companies," Mao said. The U.S. in October imposed sweeping export restrictions on shipments of American chipmaking tools to China. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
