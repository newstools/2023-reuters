March 6 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) said on Monday it resumed final testing of its advanced F-35 fighter jets, after the U.S. Government cleared delivery of engines from supplier following a safety conncern. "Safety remains our top priority as we continue to produce the world's most advanced fighter aircraft," Lockheed said. Lockheed Martin sends its new planes on check-out flights before completing paperwork for the final sale to various customers, which includes the U.S. military. A video circulated in social media in December, which was carried by several outlets, showed an F-35B Lightning II crashing during a test with its pilot safely ejecting.
