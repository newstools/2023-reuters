ZURICH, March 10 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) shares hit a new all-time low in early trading on Friday as the European banking sector suffered the fallout from a sharp sell-off in U.S. financial stocks. The embattled bank's stock fell to 2.463 Swiss francs on the Swiss Market Index amid the sell-off. Rival UBS (UBSG.S) was down 4.7% as European banking stocks headed for their largest one-day fall in nine months. Europe's STOXX banking index (.SX7P) was down 4.2% and set for its biggest one-day slide since early June, with declines for most major names including HSBC (.HSBA.L) down 4.5% and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) off 7.9%. U.S. lender SVB Financial Group(SIVB.O) scrambled on Thursday to reassure its venture capital clients their money was safe after a capital raising led to its stock collapsing 60% and contributed to wiping out over $80 billion in value from bank shares.
