KYIV, March 4 (Reuters) - The death toll from a Russian missile strike that hit an apartment block in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia rose to 11 on Saturday after a woman's body was found in the debris, the state emergency service said. One child was among those killed in Thursday's early-morning strike on the five-storey residential building, the service said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Officials from the regional administration said in another post that a Russian S-300 missile had hit the building. In a post on Telegram shortly after the strike, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy promised to hold Russia accountable. "The terrorist state wants to turn every day for our people into a day of terror. But evil will not reign in our land." "We will drive all the occupiers out and they will definitely be held accountable for everything." Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
