COPENHAGEN, March 2 (Reuters) - A Russian flag was discovered painted onto the base of Denmark's "The Little Mermaid" statue on Thursday in what police said was a "case of vandalism" at Copenhagen's most famous landmark and a popular tourist attraction. It was not immediately known who was behind the incident, a police spokesperson said. Denmark has been a vocal critic of Russia alongside other Western nations following last year's invasion of Ukraine. The 110-year-old bronze statue depicts the little mermaid from 19th-century Danish author Hans Christian Andersen's tale of the same name, and is sat on a rock by a waterside promenade. The white, blue and red stripes of the Russian flag were painted across the front of the stone. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
