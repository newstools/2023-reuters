March 10 (Reuters) - Startup-focused lender SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) is looking to sell itself after an attempt to raise capital through a stock sale failed, CNBC reported on Friday. The bank was looking to raise more than $2 billion from investors to plug a hole in its balance sheet. Shares of the troubled company nearly halved on Friday in volatile trading with multiple halts and resumptions. SVB did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
