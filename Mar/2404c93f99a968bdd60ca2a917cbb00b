Joshi has been with rival Infosys for 22 years, and is currently the president at the company. He will take charge of the IT arm of Mahindra Group from Dec. 20 for five years, the company said in an exchange filing over the weekend. He will be succeeding CP Gurnani whose term is set to end on Dec. 19. Joshi's resignation from Infosys is the second high-profile departure from the company following that of Ravi Kumar who resigned as its president in October. At Infosys, Joshi would be on leave from March 11 with the last day with the company being June 9, according to a regulatory filing.
