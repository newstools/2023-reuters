LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Saturday that a row between the BBC and football presenter Gary Lineker over his criticism of government policy in a tweet was a matter for the broadcaster, not the government. "I hope that the current situation between Gary Lineker and the BBC can be resolved in a timely manner, but it is rightly a matter for them, not the government," he said in a statement.
